Which functions or code blocks came primarily from Copilot’s suggestions? How did you prompt it (comments, partial code, etc.)? 
Primarily blocks 1 and 2 came from copilot. I accepted its suggestions then went back and fixed anything small that stopped the code from working. Additionally I also wrote the comments.


What changes did you make to Copilot’s code (renaming variables, changing logic, simplifying steps)? Why were those changes needed?
I changed some of copilot’s code by fixing the logic for handling missing values and renaming a few functions so the script matched my comments. I made these changes because the raw copilot suggestions didn’t fully work with the messy dataset.


What you learned
I learned that while copilot is a is a useful tool to assist you, you cannot fully depend on it as it will often times get things wrong. It should mainly be used to supplement your coding not fully take it over.
