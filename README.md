This script cleans up a messy sales dataset 
The script standardizes column names, removes extra whitespace, handles missing values, and removes invalid rows. It was made using GitHub Copilot to generate and refine several data cleaning functions.

To run it, run the script and after you will see: A message saying “Cleaning complete”, preview of the cleaned data in the terminal, and a new cleaned file saved at: data/processed/sales_data_clean.csv
